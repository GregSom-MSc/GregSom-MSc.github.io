## Research and Resources
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to the research page. <br> <br>
I will post here some useful resources I've gathered, as well as some of my favorite research projects and papers. <br><br>
<b>Feel free to explore.</b></div> <br>



### Personal Research Resources

### External Resources

Here you go, some useful resources related to finance, data... More to arrive soon.


- <b>Adamantios Ntakaris et al (2017)</b> [Benchmark Dataset for Mid-Price Forecasting of Limit Order Book Data with Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03233)

  **Abstract:**
  <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: smaller;">
  Managing the prediction of metrics in high-frequency financial markets is a challenging task. An efficient way is by monitoring the dynamics of a limit order book to identify the information edge. This paper describes the first publicly available benchmark dataset of high-frequency limit order markets for mid-price prediction. We extracted normalized data representations of time series data for five stocks from the NASDAQ Nordic stock market for a time period of ten consecutive days, leading to a dataset of ~4,000,000 time series samples in total. A day-based anchored cross-validation experimental protocol is also provided that can be used as a benchmark for comparing the performance of state-of-the-art methodologies. Performance of baseline approaches are also provided to facilitate experimental comparisons. We expect that such a large-scale dataset can serve as a testbed for devising novel solutions of expert systems for high-frequency limit order book data analysis.

- <b>Gbenga Ibikunle, Seth Armitage, James Clunie (2016)</b> [The Cost of Trading from the Fund Manager's Perspective](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2836070)

  **Abstract:**
  <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: smaller;">
  The cost of executing orders could differ from the cost of trades. We estimate the cost of a fund manager’s orders to trade in shares and contracts for differences (CFDs), using data for 2013-15. We compare directly the effective half-spread (EHS) of an order with the EHS that would be inferred using market data, namely the average EHS of trades in the relevant share, and the quoted half-spread. The typical EHS of an order is approximately same as the cost inferred from market data, while the typical cost of CFDs is slightly higher. However, there is wide variation in the cost of orders, and about one third have a negative spread. The cost of orders by value exceeds the inferred cost, mainly because of a small percentage of orders with very large spreads.

- <b>Rónán Gallagher (2020)</b> [The evolving relation between dividends and flexible payouts: A different evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eufm.12288)

  **Abstract:**
  <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: smaller;">
  We study payout by UK listed companies during 1993–2018. Regular dividends remain the dominant channel, but flexible payouts (special dividends and repurchases) have grown, and they make total payout more responsive to earnings. Flexible payouts are used to augment regular dividends: few companies pay out by flexible means only, and tests indicate that they augment rather than replace regular dividends. Comparison with US evidence shows that UK companies make greater use of dividends (including specials) in relation to repurchases, and have a greater willingness to change regular dividend per share.
