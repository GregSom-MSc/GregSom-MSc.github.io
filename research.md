- [Mid-Price Prediction in a Limit Order Book](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7516563)
**Astract:**
We propose several nonparametric predictors of the mid-price in a limit order book, based on different features constructed from the order book data observed contemporaneously. contemporaneously and in the recent past. We evaluate our predictors in the context of an order execution task by constructing order execution strategies that incorporate these predictors. In our evaluations, we use a large dataset of historical order placements, cancellations, and trades over a five-month period from 2013 to 2014 for liquid stocks traded on NASDAQ. We show that some of the features achieve statistically significant improvements compared to some standard strategies that do not incorporate price forecasting. For the two features that achieve the best performance, the trading cost improvement is on the order of one basis point, which can be economically very significant for asset managers with large portfolio turnovers and for brokers with considerable trading volumes.

- [The Cost of Trading from the Fund Manager's Perspective](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2836070)

**Abstract:**
The cost of executing orders could differ from the cost of trades. We estimate the cost of a fund managerâ€™s orders to trade in shares and contracts for differences (CFDs), using data for 2013-15. We compare directly the effective half-spread (EHS) of an order with the EHS that would be inferred using market data, namely the average EHS of trades in the relevant share, and the quoted half-spread. The typical EHS of an order is approximately same as the cost inferred from market data, while the typical cost of CFDs is slightly higher. However, there is wide variation in the cost of orders, and about one third have a negative spread. The cost of orders by value exceeds the inferred cost, mainly because of a small percentage of orders with very large spreads.)
