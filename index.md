## Welcome to my personal website

<div style="text-align: justify;font-size:smaller;">
<b>Welcome!</b>

I’m a Finance and Economist Analyst with a deep interest in data science and technology. Holding an MSc in Finance, Technology, and Policy from the University of Edinburgh Business School, and a MA in Economic Theory from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), I’m driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, sustainability, and cutting-edge solutions.

<br>

Whether it’s exploring tech, sustainability, and innovation or diving into history, travel, and aquascaping, I love learning and continuously exchanging new ideas.

<br>

Feel free to explore my projects, research, and discover valuable resources that I hope will inspire you as much as they do me.
