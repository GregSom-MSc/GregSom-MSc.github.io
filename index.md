## Welcome to my personal website

<div style="text-align: justify;font-size:smaller;">
<b>Welcome!</b>

I’m a Finance and Economist Analyst with a deep interest in data science and technology. Holding an MSc in Finance, Technology, and Policy from the University of Edinburgh, and a MA in Economic Theory from ITAM, I’m driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, sustainability, and cutting-edge solutions.<br>


Whether it’s exploring tech, sustainability, and innovation or diving into history, travel, and aquascaping, I love learning and continuously exchanging new ideas. 


Feel free to explore my projects, research, and discover valuable resources that I hope will inspire you as much as they do me.


<b>If you need it, don't hesitate to contact me. </b>
